This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

<!-- 
Unit Testing
It is an essential and integral part of the software development process that helps us ensure the product’s stability.

It is the level of testing at which every component of the software is tested.

Significance of unit testing

It helps us improve the quality of code.
In a world of changing requirements, it helps us identify future breaks.
Since bugs are found early, it helps us reduce the cost of bug fixes.

Jest

Jest is a JavaScript unit testing framework, used by Facebook to test services and React applications.
Jest acts as a test runner, assertion library, and mocking library.
Jest also provides Snapshot testing, the ability to create a rendered ‘snapshot’ of a component and compare it to a previously saved ‘snapshot’.

Features of Jest
Zero Configuration
Fast and sandboxed
Extensible Framework
Mocking
Snapshot Testing

Jest is a complete testing framework that comes not only with a test runner, but also with its own assertion and mocking library. This means that, different from other testing frameworks, there is no need to install and integrate additional libraries to be able to mock, spy or make assertions.

Setup
Installing and configuring

Using CRA :
	npx create-react-app jest-and-enzyme-demo

Install Jest:
	 npm add --dev jest babel-jest @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react react-test-renderer


Jest Is Fast!
Runs tests parallelly in processes to minimize test runtime.

Runs previously failed tests first.

Automatically finds tests related to changed files.

Easy to set up JavaScript testing solution.

Provides Test isolation i.e. no two tests will ever conflict with each other.

Jest works well with other testing libraries (example Enzyme, Chai).

Using Matchers
Jest uses matchers to test values in different ways. 

Common Matchers
Numbers
Floating Numbers
Truthiness
Strings
Arrays

Who All Are Using Jest?
Jest is used by Leading companies to test web applications, node.js services, mobile apps, and APIs.

Enzyme
Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your react Components’ output.

Enzyme, created by Airbnb, adds some great additional utility methods for rendering a component, finding elements, and interacting with elements.



Installing and configuring

Using CRA :
	npx create-react-app jest-and-enzyme-demo

Install Enzyme:
	npm install --save-dev enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 enzyme-to-json -->
